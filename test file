Test1
Test with build
Test trigger with additional vcs root branch check
Test with [Build] in comment
Test with pull/*
Test with Build tag
Add pull/* to vcs root and try Build tag
Added wildcard on vcs root
Added Branch filter to all still with Build tag
Changed trigger to refs/pull/* (refs/pull/*/merge seems to be target)
Reverse other changes, added refs/pull/* to vcs root and enabled PR checker. Not using build Tag
Enabling using [Build] tag
Try again without vcs root and PR feature, using [Build]
Added vcs root of refs/pull/* and 1 sec check
Did not give [Build] last time
Removed text requirement, checking only branch and PR setup
Checking if canceled builds affect
Changed vcs root monitor to only refs/pull/*
Test on fresh project with vcs root and trigger on refs/pull/*
Test with webhook active
Test again with webhook deactivated and refs/(pull/*)/head in vcs root
Still no luck
Yet another commit
vcs root configuration still a mistery
Correct format seems to be refs/(pull/*)/merge
