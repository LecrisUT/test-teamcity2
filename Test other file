Trigger is picking on logical name, not actual branch so use `pull/*` syntax
This should trigger
Test with commit conflict on main
Try to change the name to main
It seems we cannot change the name of the default branch, however <default> should work in this case
Checking <default> and webhook
This should not trigger
